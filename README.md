EKF-AUSE is work mostly associated to [Chaotic dynamics and the role of covariance inflation for reduced rank Kalman filters with model error](https://www.nonlin-processes-geophys-discuss.net/npg-2018-4/)
while noisy_linear is mostly associated to [Asymptotic forecast uncertainty and the unstable subspace in the presence of additive model error](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08334)
